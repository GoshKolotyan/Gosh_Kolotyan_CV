# Fall Detection Using YOLOv8 Documentation

## 1. Introduction

This documentation provides an overview and usage guide for the Fall Detection system using YOLOv8. This system analyzes video streams to detect falls in real-time.

## 2. Installation

Before using the Fall Detection system, you need to set up the required environment:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Ultralytics (YOLOv8)
- Pretrained YOLOv8 model for pose estimation

To install the necessary libraries, use the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless ultralytics
```

## 3. Usage

### a. Configuration

The configuration for the Fall Detection system can be found in the provided code. Adjust the following parameters according to your requirements:

- Video source (`'video_2.mp4'`): Replace this with the path to your input video file.
- Confidence threshold (`conf=0.25`): Adjust the confidence threshold for pose detection.
- Output video parameters: Configure video output settings (codec, frame rate, output file).

### b. Running Fall Detection

To run the Fall Detection system, execute the Python script. This script reads frames from the input video, performs pose estimation using YOLOv8, calculates relevant angles, and detects falls in real-time.

```bash
python fall_detection_script.py
```

## 4. Algorithm Explanation

### a. Angle Calculation

The system calculates three angles:
- Hip angle
- Knee angle
- Back angle

These angles are computed based on key points extracted from the human pose estimation.

### b. Fall Detection Logic

The system detects falls by analyzing the changes in hip, knee, and back angles over consecutive frames. If a fall is detected, the system annotates the video frame with "Fall Detected."

## 5. Example

An example use case of the Fall Detection system is provided in the code. It loads a video, processes each frame, and annotates frames where falls are detected.

## 6. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues or errors while using the Fall Detection system, please refer to the troubleshooting section in the code for guidance.

## 7. Contributing

Contributions to the Fall Detection system are welcome. If you want to contribute to the project or report issues, please follow the guidelines mentioned in the code.
